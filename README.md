# Bricks

Bricks `Build` is a sandbox and instruction manual collection for building DeFi smart contracts for Ethereum blockchains.
  - Build Tokens
  - Build Exchanges
  - Build other cool DeFi dApps

## Requirements
 - Node.js & npm (If you don't have them, don't know, and/or npm command doesn't work in your terminal, install [here](https://nodejs.org/en/))
 - Truffle (npm install -g truffle)
 - Ganache (If you don't have it, install [here](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache))
 - Basic understanding of how all of these work.

### Installation

```git clone https://github.com/BricksSandbox/build```

Bricks requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v13+ to run properly

Open Your Ganache application and open a workspace, keeping the default settings and using your bricks directory's truffle-config.js file to start the project from within Ganache. This will create a personal blockchain which responds to this particular project.

Run `truffle migrate` to deploy the smart contracts in the repo and start playing around.

The /contracts/kits/ folder contains all the projects you can work on. Select a project and start in the /before folder to see the code pre-exploits. Look for `BrickHint` keywords to find hints to add the exploits and make the whole thing come alive in each of the files. You can refer to the /after folder, to see the answers and test, too.

Navigate to the  /manuals folder, and select a .md file tied to a particular exploit you would like to build. The /contracts/kits folder contains all the different kits connected to manuals (same name).
